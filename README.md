# Tabletop Simulator

A lightweight, desktop-based tabletop simulator built with Electron and React, designed to bring the tabletop gaming experience to your computer. This app allows users to load custom board images, place and manipulate tokens, draw on the board, measure distances with a ruler, and save/load game states for seamless gameplay.

See the Roadmap section at the end of this document for a list of planned features.

## Features

- **_Custom Boards_**: Load any image as your game board.

- **_Token Management_**: Add, move, resize, duplicate, and delete tokens with ease. Tokens automatically receive labels when multiple instances of the same image are added.

- **_Drawing Tools_**: Draw on the board with multiple colors and erase as needed.

- **_Ruler Tool_**: Measure distances on the board with a simple drag-and-drop ruler.

- **_Save/Load Games_**: Save your game state to a JSON file and load it later to resume where you left off.

- **_Reset Board_**: Clear the board, tokens, and drawings with a single click.

- **_Cross-Platform_**: Built with Electron, the app can be packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Screenshots

(TODO: Add screenshots of the app in action, such as the main interface, a board with tokens, and the drawing/ruler tools.)

## Roadmap

- Deployment

  - Add support for pre-built installers in the GitHub Releases section.

  - Support for undo/redo actions.
  - Enhance token management with custom labels and rotation.

- Styling / UI / UX
  - When in ruler, draw and erase modes, replace default cursor on canvas with a custom icon.

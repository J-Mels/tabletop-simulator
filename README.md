# Tabletop Simulator

A lightweight, desktop-based tabletop simulator built with Electron and React, designed to bring the tabletop gaming experience to your computer. This app allows users to load custom board images, place and manipulate tokens, draw on the board, measure distances with a ruler, and save/load game states for seamless gameplay.

## Features

Custom Boards: Load any image as your game board.
Token Management: Add, move, resize, duplicate, and delete tokens with ease. Tokens automatically receive labels when multiple instances of the same image are added.
Drawing Tools: Draw on the board with multiple colors and erase as needed.
Ruler Tool: Measure distances on the board with a simple drag-and-drop ruler.
Save/Load Games: Save your game state to a JSON file and load it later to resume where you left off.
Reset Board: Clear the board, tokens, and drawings with a single click.
Cross-Platform: Built with Electron, the app can be packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Screenshots

(TODO: Add screenshots of the app in action, such as the main interface, a board with tokens, and the drawing/ruler tools.)
